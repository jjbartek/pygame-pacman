# Pygame pacman
## ðŸŽ² About Game
This game was created as a final project for the college course "object-oriented programming 2". The game replicates the famous Japanese game Pac-Man, and is entirely created in python using the pygame library. The game uses publicly available sounds from the original game, and most of the graphics were created by me.

### Implemented features:
* Levels (changes entities speed, ghost modes duration etc.),
* 3 ghosts modes (scatter, chase, frightened),
* Tunnels,
* Pause menu,
* Sounds,
* Real-time statistics,
* Hints (ghosts' target cells)
